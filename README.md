# CortexType: Typing using thoughts

## Background and Objectives

The P300 Speller, utilizing advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, introduces a communication pathway directly from the brain to, particularly beneficial for individuals with severe physical disabilities. This innovative system taps into the P300 brainwave, a distinct electrical response the brain emits roughly 300 milliseconds after recognizing a stimulus. By identifying these signals, the P300 Speller can pinpoint the character you are focusing on, enabling communication without the need for physical movement. This interface not only eases interaction with computers but also significantly improves your ability to connect with the surrounding environment.

The project is implemented as part of [Neureality Hackathon](https://neureality-cu.github.io/Neureality/hackathon.html).
