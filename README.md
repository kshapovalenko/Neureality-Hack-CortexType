# CortexType: EEG-Based Thought-to-Text Conversion

## Background and Objectives

CortexType revolutionizes the way individuals with severe physical disabilities communicate with the world. Harnessing the power of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, this project focuses on the P300 brainwave, a specific electrical signal emitted by the brain. By interpreting these signals, CortexType allows users to type text on a computer using their thoughts alone. This approach offers a new realm of independence and interaction for those who face challenges with conventional communication methods.

The project is implemented as part of [Neureality Hackathon](https://neureality-cu.github.io/Neureality/hackathon.html).

## EEG Device and Data Collection
The data was collected lively via the [8-channel EEG Unicorn Hybrid Black](https://www.gtec.at/product/unicorn-hybrid-black/).

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the following files and directories:
- `models` folder: Code of different encoder-decoder models 
- `starter-code-unity` folder: Code to start VR/AR session
- `hackathon-task-description.pdf`: Task description
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the contents of the repository.
